Bugs & Requests
---------------

If you experience a bug or have any feature requests, please let me know in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/alexgurrola/RepeatableActionTimer/issues) on the Github Repository.  Since I recently started playing Elder Scrolls Online for the first time, there will likely be much more to be desired, so don't be shy.  ;)
