# RepeatableActionTimer

Overview
--------

This addon keeps track of when a repeatable action can be repeated.

Usage
-------

Go into your keybinds and bind a key for <font color="5cb0fc">Action Timer</font>, which will have its font in the same color as you see here.  This will toggle the window to see all the timers for each character.  Initially, it will only show the current character, but, as you log-in to others, it will calibrate their clocks as well.

Actions
-------

- Shadowy Supplier
- Stables

Bugs & Requests
---------------

If you experience a bug or have any feature requests, please let me know in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/alexgurrola/RepeatableActionTimer/issues) on the Github Repository.  Since I recently started playing Elder Scrolls Online for the first time, there will likely be much more to be desired, so don't be shy.  ;)
